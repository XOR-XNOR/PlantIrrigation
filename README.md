# Plant Watering Prediction Machine Learning Model
# Problem Statement
The objective of this machine learning model is to predict when and how much water is needed by plants based on temperature and moisture readings. The model takes in temperature and moisture readings as input and outputs the amount of water needed by the plant.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this machine learning model contains historical temperature and moisture readings for a group of plants over a month during the summer. The dataset has the following features:

1. Date: the date of the reading (in YYYY-MM-DD format)
2. Temperature: the temperature reading (in degrees Celsius)
3. Moisture: the moisture reading (as a percentage)
4. Watering: the ideal amount of water given to the plant (in ml)

# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is necessary if there is any missing or irrelevant data or any categorical variables or scaling problem. We have gone through all these steps.

# Machine Learning Algorithm
The machine learning algorithm used for this model is the Multiple Linear Regression and the Decision Tree Regression algorithm. Both Multiple linear regression and decision tree regression are two common machine learning algorithms used for predicting numerical values.

# Model Training and Testing
The dataset is split into training and testing sets with a ratio of 80:20. Both models are trained on the training set and tested on the testing set. The performance of the model is evaluated using the mean squared error (MSE) metric.

# Usage
The trained machine learning model can be used in practice to determine when and how much to water plants. The user needs to input the temperature and moisture readings for a specific date, and the model will output the amount of water needed by the plant.

# Limitations and Challenges
One potential limitation of using machine learning for plant watering prediction is that the model may not be accurate if the environmental conditions change significantly. For example, if there is a sudden change in temperature or humidity, the model may not be able to predict the optimal amount of water needed by the plant. Additionally, the model may require a large amount of data to accurately predict the water needs of different types of plants in different environments.

# Conclusion
The plant watering prediction machine learning model can be a useful tool for plant enthusiasts to ensure that their plants are receiving the optimal amount of water. By using historical temperature and moisture readings, the model can predict the water needs of plants and reduce the risk of over or under watering. However, it is important to be aware of the limitations and challenges of using machine learning in this context and to monitor the performance of the model over time.
